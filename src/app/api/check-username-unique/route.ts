//now the thing about zod is

//1....   first u make up a schema 
//2....  then u validate that the data is valid according to the schema
//3.... the schema only holds the data types and the validation rules 
//4.... over here we are practically validating the username and this username is validating saperately because
//5.... i want to check the username in the unput box only and give the suggestion to the user while he is typing and show him that the username is already taken or not
//6.... so we are douing it saperately
//7.... but when u do it for the whole sign up form then u can use the signUpSchema to validate the whole form
//8.... there whole of the fields will be validated and then the data will be sent to the server in one single schema only


//getting the schema for the username
